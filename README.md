# Raspet-Flight-Display
Developed for the Raspet Flight Research Laboratory to provide a near real-time maneuverability warning system during flight operations. Using telemetry data of aircraft surfaces transmitted from the UAS to the ground control station, data is among other things, converted to a workable format and passed through a set of equations. The results are checked against each other to determine if the aircraft is near or exceeding the limitations of it's maneuverability under the modified operating condition. Allowing flight operations crew and researchers to make decisions during flight and analyze data afterwards.
